# Clean Architecture (Currently Studying)

- Became a Book
- Main Objective: Protect the Application Domain
- Hexagonal Architecture and Clean Architecture are similar, however, The Clean Architecture has more details (however, it is still open to how the developer will implement).
- It is a variation of Hexagonal Architecture, however, bringing more details (evolution).
- Low accouplement between layers (Interfaces).
- Oriented by Use Cases (Intent of action. With it, you can see the intention of the system).

- Each Use Case has a DTO for Input and a DTO for Output. Use Cases can variable in accord to the flux (that'Å› why they are not a part of entities)
- Presenters: Transformation Object (Similar to DTO Mapper)
- Entities from Clean Architecture are different from DDD Entities
- Entities In Clean Architecture: Business Rules Layer
- There is no explicit definition of how to create entities. We use some tactics from DDD (just a correlation).
- Entities from Clean Architecture: Aggregates + Domain Services
